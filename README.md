A CV+DL Algorithm for detecting/highlighting volleyballs for the visually impaired üèê

This project uses a HSV color picker to identify objects that are similar to the color of the ball. It then uses a binary classifier to detect the balls and non-balls. Furthermore, it uses a heuristic algorithm in order to choose the most viable option for a ball if there are multiple detected.
